    Greta Thunberg is an environmental activist. At the age of 15, Greta missed school to sit outside the Swedish parliament with a sign which read ‘SCHOOL STRIKE FOR CLIMATE’, her aim was to encourage politicians to take more action against climate change. Since then, tens of thousands of students from around the world have joined her #FridaysforFuture strikes – skipping school on Fridays to protest against climate change.
